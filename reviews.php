                                    <h4>“I have been a licensed Realtor for over 16 years in Louisiana. In the past 6 months, I have closed 4 Bond for Deed sales, using Unique Escrow  to facilitate the close. With the stringent guidelines many lenders have today, it's great to have other options to offer a Buyer and Seller. Unique Escrow  has helped me bring many buyers to the closing table by providing the Seller with the benefits of selling under Bond for Deed. Unique Escrow  takes the time to contact them directly and answer any questions they may have. During the Closing, Unique Escrow  goes through all documents clearly so both parties understand and feel confident in their decision to buy/sell through Bond for Deed. In addition to knowledge and aid throughout the transaction, Unique Escrow  charges more reasonable fees than other companies that provided this service. I highly recommend Unique Escrow  for any Realtor looking to close a BFD.”</h4>

I find that buyers are motivated to do what they need to do to refinance in whatever time frame is agreed upon. A Bond for Deed allows a seller to get out from under a house note while waiting for the buyer to refinance and get the home in their name. Bond for Deed provides a mechanism to get the property back easily and inexpensively and within a short time frame if, for some reason, the buyer doesn't live up to their obligations. Unique Escrow provides good service and offers a quality product!”</h4>
